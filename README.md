This project delves into option pricing methodologies, spanning from European, Binary American and Asian options. Non-linear solvers such as the Newton-Raphson and Bisection methods are employed, along with techniques for delta, gamma, and vega calculations. Object-oriented programming principles like Polymorphism and Inheritance are leveraged to introduce advanced features and enhance code reusability.
